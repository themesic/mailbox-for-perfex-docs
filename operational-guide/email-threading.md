## 🎯 What is Email Threading?

Email Threading automatically groups:

- Related messages in a single thread

**Benefits:**
- See entire conversation at a glance
- Reduce inbox clutter
- Easier to follow email discussions
- Gmail-style conversation view

## ✅ Prerequisites

Email Threading must be enabled in **Setup → Settings → Mailbox Settings → Enable Email Threading**.

## 📧 How Threading Works

When threading is enabled:
- Related emails are grouped together
- Original email appears first
- Replies appear below in chronological order
- Thread can be expanded or collapsed

### Thread Indicators

- **Thread Icon**: Shows number of messages in thread
- **Expand/Collapse**: Click to show/hide thread messages
- **Unread Count**: Shows unread messages in thread

## ⚙️ Threading Settings

### Enable/Disable Threading

1. Go to **Setup → Settings → Mailbox Settings**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Threading is based on email headers (In-Reply-To, References)
- Not all email clients create proper threading headers
- Some emails may not thread correctly if headers are missing
- Threading works best with standard email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Threading feature must be enabled in Settings
