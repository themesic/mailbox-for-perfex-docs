# 📦 Archiving Emails

Archiving emails helps you keep your inbox clean while preserving important messages. Archived emails are moved to a separate Archive folder but remain accessible and searchable.

## 🎯 What is Archiving?

Archiving is different from deleting:
- **Archive**: Moves email out of inbox but keeps it accessible
- **Delete**: Permanently removes email (moved to Trash)

Archived emails can be:
- Searched
- Restored to inbox
- Accessed from the Archive folder
- Tagged and organized

## ✅ Prerequisites

The Archive feature must be enabled in **Setup → Settings → Mailbox Settings → Enable Archive Feature**.
